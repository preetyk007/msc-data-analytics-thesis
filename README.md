Research Project

An image classification model by combining Convolutional Neural Networks and Support Vector Machine for land use and land cover scene classification.
CNN namely, ResNet-152 was modified and used for deep feature extraction.
A stack of fully-connected layers and SVM both were compared for scene classification. This project was implemented using Python programming language
